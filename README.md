Hi! I’m @hkwheat, a computer science master's student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I'm also a soccer referee for various youth leagues in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In my spare time, I enjoy trail running, staring at cars I can't afford, and composing music for guitar and piano.

You can find me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/haley-wheatley/
